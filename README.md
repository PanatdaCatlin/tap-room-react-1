####  Keg tracking application for bars

#### By Hyewon Cho

## Description

A web application for bars to keep track of their kegs.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository(https://github.com/hyewon92cho/tap-room-react.git).
* Download Node js from this [website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install it.
* Open Mac Terminal or Windows Command Prompt.
* Type "cd tap-room-react" and press enter to go to the solution directory.
* Type "npm install" to install dependencies.
* Type "npm run start" and press enter to run the local server.
* Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8080/.

## Specifications

1. As a patron, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I need to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent (or perhaps something like flavor for a kombucha store).
2. As an employee, I want to fill out a form when I tap a new keg to add it to the list. (Don't worry about authenticating employee user accounts yet.)
3. As an employee, I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake.
4. As a patron and/or employee, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. (Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints).
5. As an employee, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1.
6. As an employee, I want to be able to see kegs with less than 10 pints left so I can be ready to change them.
7. As a patron, I want to have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability. Perhaps based on their price (greater or less than $5 per pint, perhaps) or the particular style of beer or kombucha.
8. As a patron, I want to use the alcohol content property to display stronger beers differently than weaker beers.
